Hi, I am Alessandro and i wanted to create this site in order to experiment writing articles and share some of my thoughts about tech, videogames and science.

This is a static site built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), hosted on [Github](https://github.com) and deployed through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). The theme i am using is [this one](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-stack/). 

That's it, I hope you enjoy.
