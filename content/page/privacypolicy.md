By visiting this site, you consent to the data practices listed below.

#### Data collection is at its lowest possible üëÄ

This site does not collect data about you unless it is voluntarily provided. Examples of this type of data collection is any info submitted in the contact form. This data is not sold to any third parties and is only used for personal uses such as knowing who sent me a contact form. 

Furthermore users are not tracked when visiting the site.

#### Cookies üç™

tecnicanimal.me may set cookies only when necessary in order to include tools that can enhance the web browsing experience. One example of cookie usage is knowing the zoom value you set in a Google Maps location, so that when you return to visit the page, it is automatically set for you. 

I tend to reduce cookie usage as much as possible, trying to strike a balance between browsing experience and hardcore privacy.

### Identity of the data controller

Users can contact Alessandro Bolis at bolis.a@protonmail.com for requests regarding privacy.
