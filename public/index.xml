      <description>Historically present in Central Europe rocky regions, starting from the 16th century through the 19th century, due to overexploitation and poaching, the alpine ibex (Capra ibex) became extirpated in most areas. Remaining populations were only present in the western Italian Alps around the Gran Paradiso and Vanoise massifs.
After the Gran Paradiso was made into a national park in 1922, resulting in ibexes being protected from poaching, their populations grew in surrounding areas, repopulating Italian and French alpine ranges, southern Germany, Switzerland and Austria, mainly thanks to reintroductions.</description>

      <description>Introduction: Importance of audio A good gaming experience is not all about graphics and frame rate. Although they play a big role in making a videogame immersive, in my experience audio is one of the major components that drives sensations when experiencing digital content. The same goes for movies according to George Lucas.
 While stereo sound is one-dimensional, since itâ€™s coming from the front, left and right, surround sound added a second dimension with sound coming from the back.</description>
